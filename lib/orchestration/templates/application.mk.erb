#
# Example test command
#
# This command will call `test-setup` before running your usual test pipeline.
#
# `test-setup` starts all containers specified in `docker-compose.test.yml`,
# waits for them to be ready, and runs DB migrations.
#
# In your CI environment, simply run `make test`.
#
.PHONY: test
test: test-setup
	bundle exec rspec
        bundle exec rubocop
