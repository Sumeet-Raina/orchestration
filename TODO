Refactor docker-compose services - these really belong in
lib/orchestration/services/<service-name>/docker_compose.rb

Standardise on log formats - by policy or recommendation ?

Redis support

Use `Paint` instead of `Colorize` for colouring output - better licensing and no
monkeypatching `String` etc.

Make unicorn `config.rb` resilient to database connectivity failures

Environment-based config in `orchestration.yml`. Move template files out of
`orchestration/` and store inside gem; generate on the fly on each invocation.
Config entries in `orchestration.yml` will override defaults (using
docker-compose to merge configs).

Group healthcheck rake tasks - run all at once in the same process. Create a
master process that generates config files and calls each healthcheck in batch.

Provide a way of declaratively configuring bespoke healthchecks.
