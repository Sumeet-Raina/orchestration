Refactor docker-compose services - these really belong in
lib/orchestration/services/<service-name>/docker_compose.rb

Standardise on log formats - by policy or recommendation ?

Redis support

Use `Paint` instead of `Colorize` for colouring output - better licensing and no
monkeypatching `String` etc.
