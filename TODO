Provide volumes for databases and mount appropriate directories for adapter

Refactor docker-compose services - these really belong in
lib/orchestration/services/<service-name>/docker_compose.rb

Standardise on log formats - by policy or recommendation ?

Redis support

Stop supporting development mode. Provide a docker-compose.yml for loading
development and test dependencies and expect user to run Rails application
locally.

Build a docker-compose.production.yml for running application in
production (i.e. including application as a service and removing local port
bindings).

Make docker-compose file additive - detect existing services and add new ones
rather than overwriting.
